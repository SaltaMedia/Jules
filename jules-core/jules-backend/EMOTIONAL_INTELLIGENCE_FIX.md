# EMOTIONAL INTELLIGENCE FIX
*Created: July 19, 2025*
*Status: Fixed Jules suggesting shopping therapy for emotional pain*

## Problem Identified:
- Jules was suggesting accessories and shopping when users shared emotional pain (ghosting, rejection)
- This was tone-deaf and showed poor emotional intelligence
- Example: User says "I got ghosted" → Jules suggests "buy an accessory"

## Root Cause:
- System prompt was missing emotional intelligence guidance
- Product-focused language was overriding emotional support needs
- No context awareness for emotional vs. practical requests

## Fix Applied:

### Added Emotional Intelligence Section to System Prompt:
```javascript
### EMOTIONAL INTELLIGENCE
- When someone shares emotional pain (ghosting, rejection, loneliness), provide emotional support first
- Don't immediately suggest shopping or products for emotional problems
- Focus on empathy, validation, and emotional processing before any practical advice
- Only suggest fashion/style improvements when the person is ready to move forward
```

## Expected Behavior Now:

### ✅ Emotional Pain Responses:
- **"I got ghosted"** → Emotional support, validation, empathy
- **"Dating sucks"** → Understanding, emotional processing
- **"I feel alone"** → Compassion, emotional support

### ✅ Product Requests (Still Work):
- **"Show me some shoes"** → Product recommendations
- **"Got any examples of loafers?"** → Product cards
- **"Help me find a jacket"** → Shopping suggestions

### ✅ Mixed Context:
- **"I got ghosted but want to look good for my next date"** → Emotional support first, then style advice

## Testing Status:
- ✅ System prompt updated with emotional intelligence guidance
- ✅ Product functionality preserved (loafers, vans detection working)
- ✅ Backend server running
- ✅ Ready for testing emotional vs. product responses

## Key Principle:
**Emotional support first, products only when appropriate and requested.**
