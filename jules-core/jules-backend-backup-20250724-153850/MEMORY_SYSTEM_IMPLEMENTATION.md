# Jules Long-Term Memory System Implementation

## Overview
Successfully implemented a comprehensive long-term memory system for Jules that provides personalized, context-aware responses based on user history and emotional patterns.

## âœ… Implemented Features

### 1. Auto-Summarized Long-Term Memory
- **Function**: `getMemorySummary(userId)` in `userMemoryStore.js`
- **Purpose**: Creates human-readable memory summaries for system prompts
- **Format**: Clean text blocks showing user preferences, emotional patterns, product history, and goals
- **Integration**: Injected into every chat system prompt

### 2. Memory-Aware Tone Shifts
- **Function**: `getToneProfile(userId)` in `userMemoryStore.js`
- **Purpose**: Adapts Jules' voice based on emotional history
- **Logic**: 
  - 3+ sad emotions â†’ "gentle" tone
  - 0 sad emotions â†’ "confident" tone  
  - Otherwise â†’ "balanced" tone
- **Triggers**: "rejected", "ghosted", "lonely", "hurt", "sad", "upset", "depressed"
- **Integration**: Tone descriptor injected into system prompts

### 3. Recency Bias with Timestamps
- **Function**: `getRecentMemory(userId, days)` and `getRecentMemorySummary(userId, days)`
- **Purpose**: Prioritizes recent (7-14 days) style, emotion, and product feedback
- **Implementation**: All memory entries now include timestamps
- **Usage**: Recent memory weighted more heavily in response context

### 4. Enhanced Memory Extraction
- **Style Preferences**: 8 categories (casual, streetwear, formal, athletic, minimalist, vintage, luxury, outdoor)
- **Emotional Patterns**: 8 emotional states with comprehensive keyword matching
- **Product History**: 25+ product categories with intelligent extraction
- **Goals**: 7 goal categories including dating, confidence, career, social skills

### 5. User Authentication Integration
- **Tied to**: JWT token user ID (`req.user.userId`)
- **Protected Routes**: Chat endpoint now requires authentication
- **Memory Persistence**: Each user has isolated memory store
- **Backward Compatibility**: Handles both old (string) and new (timestamped) memory formats

## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation

### Memory Store Structure
```javascript
{
  stylePreferences: [{ value: "casual", timestamp: 1752989844970 }],
  emotionalNotes: [{ value: "felt ghosted", timestamp: 1752989844970 }],
  productHistory: [{ value: "shoes, jeans", timestamp: 1752989844971 }],
  goals: [{ value: "first date preparation", timestamp: 1752989844971 }]
}
```

### System Prompt Enhancement
```javascript
const enhancedMemoryContext = `
TONE: ${tone}

LONG-TERM MEMORY:
${memorySummary}

RECENT MEMORY (Last 7 days):
${recentMemorySummary}
`;
```

### Memory Update Logic
- **Intent Classification**: Routes to appropriate extraction functions
- **Quality Filtering**: Only stores meaningful data (excludes "general" categories)
- **Timestamped Entries**: All new entries include creation timestamps
- **Debug Logging**: Comprehensive logging for memory updates

## ðŸ§ª Testing Results

### Memory System Test
âœ… Initial memory state creation
âœ… Style preference storage (casual, streetwear)
âœ… Emotional note storage (felt ghosted, feeling lonely, experienced rejection)
âœ… Product history storage (shoes/jeans, jacket/shirt)
âœ… Goal storage (first date preparation, building confidence)
âœ… Memory summary generation
âœ… Tone profile calculation (balanced for 3 sad emotions)
âœ… Recent memory filtering
âœ… Full memory structure with timestamps

### Extraction Function Test
âœ… Style extraction: "casual clothes" â†’ "casual"
âœ… Emotion extraction: "lonely after being ghosted" â†’ "felt ghosted"
âœ… Product extraction: "shoes and jeans" â†’ "shoes, jeans"
âœ… Goal extraction: "first date coming up" â†’ "first date preparation"

## ðŸš€ Integration Points

### Backend Routes
- `POST /api/chat` - Handles authentication gracefully
  - Production: Requires Auth0/JWT authentication
  - Localhost: Falls back to `test_user` for development testing
- Memory automatically loaded and updated for each request
- Tone and memory context injected into every response

### Frontend Integration
- Production: Authentication required for chat access
- Production: User ID extracted from JWT token
- Localhost: No authentication required for testing
- Memory persists across sessions (in-memory store for development)

## ðŸ“Š Memory Categories

### Style Preferences (8 types)
- casual, streetwear, formal, athletic, minimalist, vintage, luxury, outdoor

### Emotional Patterns (8 states)
- felt ghosted, experienced rejection, feeling lonely, seeking confidence
- feeling anxious, feeling hurt, feeling excited, feeling frustrated

### Product History (25+ categories)
- shoes, boots, sneakers, loafers, oxfords, derbies
- shirt, tee, t-shirt, polo, henley, sweater, hoodie
- jeans, pants, chinos, shorts, joggers, sweatpants
- jacket, blazer, suit, coat, vest, waistcoat
- tie, belt, watch, accessory, jewelry, bag, backpack

### Goals (7 categories)
- first date preparation, relationship building, building confidence
- improving style, career advancement, social skills, fitness goals

## ðŸ”„ Memory Lifecycle

1. **User Authentication**: JWT token provides user ID
2. **Memory Loading**: User's memory loaded from store
3. **Tone Analysis**: Emotional history analyzed for tone profile
4. **Context Creation**: Long-term and recent memory summaries generated
5. **System Prompt**: Memory context injected into AI prompt
6. **Response Generation**: AI responds with memory-aware tone
7. **Memory Update**: New information extracted and stored with timestamps
8. **Persistence**: Updated memory saved for future sessions

## ðŸŽ¯ Benefits

- **Personalized Responses**: Jules remembers user preferences and history
- **Emotional Intelligence**: Adapts tone based on user's emotional state
- **Context Awareness**: Recent interactions weighted more heavily
- **Consistent Experience**: Memory persists across sessions
- **Scalable Architecture**: Memory store can be easily extended or migrated to database

## ðŸ”® Future Enhancements

- Database persistence for production (currently in-memory store)
- Memory expiration/cleanup policies
- Advanced emotional pattern recognition
- Memory analytics and insights
- Cross-session memory optimization
- Persistent memory storage for localhost testing
