# PRODUCT LOGIC FIX BACKUP
*Created: July 19, 2025*
*Status: Fixed product detection while preserving backup system prompt*

## Issue Fixed:
- Product cards were not showing when users asked for specific products like "loafers" or "vans"
- The clothingOutfitRequest regex was missing these common product terms
- Product detection logic was too restrictive

## Changes Made:

### 1. Reverted to Backup System Prompt
- ✅ System prompt is exactly the same as commit `b2fc503` (the good fallback version)
- ✅ All personality and tone settings preserved
- ✅ No changes to the core Jules personality

### 2. Fixed Product Detection Logic
**Before:**
```javascript
const clothingOutfitRequest = /(shorts|shoes|jacket|shirt|tee|t-shirt|graphic|jeans|pants|sneakers|boots|suit|blazer|tie|belt|watch|accessory|outfit|clothing|apparel|fashion|dress|wear|brand|ten thousand|lululemon|nike|adidas|brooks|asics|levi|uniqlo|jcrew|target|amazon)/i.test(message);
```

**After:**
```javascript
const clothingOutfitRequest = /(shorts|shoes|jacket|shirt|tee|t-shirt|graphic|jeans|pants|sneakers|boots|suit|blazer|tie|belt|watch|accessory|outfit|clothing|apparel|fashion|dress|wear|brand|ten thousand|lululemon|nike|adidas|brooks|asics|levi|uniqlo|jcrew|target|amazon|loafers|vans)/i.test(message);
```

### 3. Preserved Restrictive Logic
- ✅ Kept the restrictive `&&` logic from backup version
- ✅ Kept the exclusions for "advice" and "help" requests
- ✅ Only added missing product terms to the regex

## What This Fixes:
- "got any examples of stylish loafers?" → Now detects as product request
- "how about some white vans?" → Now detects as product request
- "show me some graphic t's" → Already working, still works
- "I need advice on dating" → Still correctly excluded from product requests

## What's Preserved:
- ✅ Jules's personality and tone (exactly as backup)
- ✅ Message truncation fix (stripClosers function)
- ✅ All other functionality unchanged
- ✅ Product search and filtering logic unchanged

## Testing Status:
- ✅ Backend server running on port 4000
- ✅ Frontend server running on port 3000
- ✅ Product detection now includes "loafers" and "vans"
- ✅ System prompt unchanged from working backup version

## Notes:
- This is a minimal, surgical fix that only adds missing product terms
- No changes to the core system prompt or personality
- No changes to the restrictive product detection logic
- Ready for testing on localhost:3000
